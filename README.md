# Overview
This application is written in C++ and the idea is to get two String inputs lines and then map both the lines to check if they are similar or not.


- It will print yes if all the words in second string are present in the first string
### Example:
```
String one = "Hi there how are you"
String two = "Hi there how"
Output "Yes"
```
- It will print No if even one word is missing in the first string
### Example
```
String one = "Hi there how are you"
String two = "Hi there me"
Output "No"
```

- This code is running pretty good. But the only problem with this code is the time complexity
