# RansomNote
This program takes input of two string.
Then it matches the second string with the first one and if all of the words contained in second string are present in first one then it prints Yes. 
Else No


Example:
String one = "Hi there how are you"
String two = "Hi there how"

Output "Yes"

Example:
String one = "Hi there how are you"
String two = "Hi there me"

Output "No"

This code is running pretty good. But the only problem with it is time complexity. 
I want someone to improve its timecompexity by giving some suggestions.
